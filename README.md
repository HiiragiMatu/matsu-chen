# node-list

Node.js, Express, mongodb...

This project is created for my own purpose. To be honest, I have longing for having my own website for quite long and, in the past years, I did have attempted to make a website from scratch. However, the results are very bad or could call them failures. I once utilzied flask which is a framework written in Python, but this time I think the use the same programming language would be fast when run a website. As a result, this time, I choose node.js as backend in order to accompany JS in frontend.

Below are the things I want to create on this website:
1.Store my reseacrh projects in AI field such as a chat-bot or motto-creating using nlp.
2.Store my application projects such as calling or gps service.
